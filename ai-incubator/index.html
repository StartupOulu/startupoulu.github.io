            The startup ecosystem is expanding, new companies are being born,
            and ambitious teams are setting off on an adventure toward global
            market leadership in their industries.
          </h3>

          <p>
            StartupOulu AI Incubator is the next step in this journey:
            <strong
              >a 9-month program where you take an AI idea to your first
              customer—and toward a growing company.</strong
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            The incubator has a clear goal: to create a growth-driven company
            that solves a big problem, scales globally, and does it all from
            Oulu.

          <h2>Who is the AI Incubator for?</h2>

          <p>The AI Incubator is for you or your team if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong
                >You have a business idea with the potential to become a global
                market leader in your field.</strong
              >
              We're looking for teams and ideas that can grow into companies
              with tens or hundreds of millions in revenue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Your team is motivated and committed.</strong> The
              preferred team size is maximum of 4 people. Small teams move fast,
              exactly how early-stage startups should.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AI is at the core of your idea</strong> – an AI component
              enables scalable growth. Often this means a B2B solution, but what
              matters most is clear value for a specific customer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >You're ready to build the company in the Oulu region</strong
              >
              – the company created through the program will be founded here.
              This is a requirement for participation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Language isn't a barrier.</strong> You can take part in
              Finnish or English.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>You're doing this seriously.</strong> We expect at least
              15 hours per week invested in pushing your idea forward—preferably
              more.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you recognize yourself in these points, you're exactly the kind
            of person we're looking for.

          <h2>How does the AI Incubator work?</h2>

          <p>
            The AI Incubator runs in groups to create a shared rhythm and strong
            peer support:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>A new group starts roughly every 6 months</li>
            <li>Each group stays in the incubator for a maximum of 9 months</li>
            <li>
              The program has three phases:
              <ul>
                <li>Problem validation (1 month)</li>
                <li>Solution validation (2 months)</li>
                <li>Toward your first customer (6 months)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            On top of that, teams commit to a "build in public" mindset: each
            cohort shares its progress openly, along with key lessons and
            exciting pivots. You're not expected to reveal trade secrets. Public
            progress keeps focus sharp and makes the journey visible to
            customers and partners too.

          <h2>What you get if you are accepted</h2>

          <p>Here's what's in it for you:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Structured path from idea to revenue</strong> – No
              guesswork. You'll follow a Lean Canvas inspired framework that
              stops you from building something nobody wants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hands-on mentorship</strong> – Access to experienced
              founders, industry experts, and AI specialists who've been where
              you're going. They'll challenge your assumptions and sharpen your
              thinking.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A cohort that pushes you forward</strong> – You're not
              doing this alone. Other teams start at the same time with you and
              they become your accountability partners, and your first network
              in the ecosystem.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Connections that matter</strong> – Introductions to
              potential customers, investors, and partners in the Oulu region.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Visibility from day one</strong> – Building in public
              means customers and investors can find you before you even launch.
              Your progress becomes your marketing.

          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="incubator-section">
          <h2>Program phases</h2>

          <h3>1. Problem validation (1 month)</h3>

          <p>The first month is all about validating the customer problem:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Find out whether your target customers have a real, recurring,
              meaningful problem
            </li>
            <li>
              Confirm that the problem is important enough that customers are
              willing to pay to solve it
            </li>
            <li>Identify who is affected most by the problem</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>If the problem doesn't validate,</strong> you have two
            paths: restart Phase 1 with a new angle or a new problem—or leave
            the program. This saves you months of building the wrong thing.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Solution validation (2 months)</h3>

          <p>
            In this phase, you build a nearly working prototype to test how well
            your solution actually solves the customer's problem.
          </p>

          <p>During this phase:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You create a prototype that customers can genuinely try</li>
            <li>
              You test whether your product solves the problem in a way
              customers truly care about
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>If the solution doesn't validate, the team can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Return to Phase 1,</li>
            <li>Repeat Phase 2,</li>
            <li>Or leave the program.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Validation matters more than a slick demo.</p>

          <h3>3. Toward your first customer (6 months)</h3>

          <p>The final phase is real startup life.</p>

          <p>In this phase you'll:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Build the first real version of your product</li>
            <li>Find a repeatable customer acquisition model</li>
            <li>
              Sell, learn, and iterate—every single week should show progress
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong
              >Moving forward is a condition for staying in the program.</strong
            >
            If a team can't make progress, they will have to leave the
            incubator.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You have up to 6 months to release your first version</li>
            <li>
              When you land your first paying customer (and earn that first
              euro), we celebrate—and your time in the incubator ends.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            At that point, you've become exactly what this program exists to
            create: a growth-hungry company standing firmly on its own two feet.
