  Curious about starting your own thing but not sure where to begin? In this 90-minute workshop, you’ll learn how to come up with real startup ideas using the Lean Canvas – a super simple tool to turn problems into business opportunities. We’ll show you how startups get started, why solving real customer problems matters, and how entrepreneurship can actually be a solid career path. Plus, you'll see how new businesses help the local economy grow and why that’s a big deal. No experience needed – just bring your ideas (or come make one).
