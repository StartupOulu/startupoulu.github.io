  Polar Bear Pitching brings bold and ambitious people together — and BrainsMingle helps them meet before they even touch the ice. Meet Before You Freeze is a virtual networking session where you’ll have a series of short, one-on-one conversations with other participants. Each round is designed to help you connect, exchange ideas, and explore opportunities — naturally and without pressure.
