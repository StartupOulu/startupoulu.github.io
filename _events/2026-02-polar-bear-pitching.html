  Polar Bear Pitching is not your typical startup event. Here, founders prove their resilience by pitching from an AVANTO (Finnish for “ice hole”)! This unique tradition combines the thrill of entrepreneurship with the spirit of northern culture, creating an unforgettable setting for networking, deals, and innovation.
