  The Startup Mastermind Club is a peer-support network for startup teams and founders that have just started their journey. Each session, we invite three to five startups to present their startup and a specific challenge they’re facing, whether it’s overcoming an obstacle, finding the right connections, or making a strategic decision. In return, they receive constructive feedback, actionable advice, and new perspectives from the group.
