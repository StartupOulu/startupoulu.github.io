  Extreme pitching event held in Oulu, Finland. Unlike traditional startup pitching competitions, participants in Polar Bear Pitching deliver their pitches outdoors in freezing temperatures, standing waist-deep in icy water. The event challenges entrepreneurs to make their pitches within a limited timeframe, adding an element of endurance and creativity. Start the day at 9:00 with a deep dive into growth and sustainability at our Day Conference! At 18:00 you can watch the selected contestants show their determination to the whole world by getting into the icy cold water and pitching their startup. The Avanto Competition is an outdoor program broadcasted worldwide. All of Polar Bear Pitching ticket holders get access to watch the Avanto Competition and enjoy hot tubs, saunas, and warm drinks in the surrounding Sauna Village! Complete your experience at the afterparty in Radisson Blu hotel from 21:00 to 02:00.
