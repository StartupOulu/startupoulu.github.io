  Hack After Dark is a hacker-themed event to be held in Oulu on October 18, 2025. The event is informal and includes speeches, networking, discussions, and an awesome hacker quiz. As a low-threshold event, Hack After Dark is a great opportunity for novice speakers to try their wings or for more experienced speakers to experience a slightly different environment for giving presentations. The audience at the event has traditionally been active with questions, and sometimes there has even been unplanned discussions between speakers and participants. To ensure a low threshold, presentations at the event can be given in Finnish or English.
